# nba_win_model

A fun project to explore data science techniques and broaden my knowledge of tools related to data analytics.

Using a random forest classification model, we predict if a team will win or lose based on multiple features(variables) such as boxscore stats (pts, oreb, dreb, stls, etc)

## tech and libraries used for this project

The focus of this project was purely python and its robust data libraries. 
The main libraries used were: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and plotly
