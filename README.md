# nba_win_model
WIP
A fun project to explore data science techniques and broaden my knowledge of tools related to data analytics.

Using a random forest classification model, we predict if a team will win or lose based on multiple features(variables) such as boxscore stats (pts, oreb, dreb, stls, etc)
The benefit of a random forest model is that it is quite good at *predicting*. Where it lacks however, is if you are interested in extrapolating since this model doesnt show correlation like an OLS regression
For this project though, I was mainly interested in predicting so it works for me! 

## tech and libraries used for this project

Everything in this project was done in python.
The main libraries used were: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and plotly.
